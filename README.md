# Self-Tracking 75 Hard Plan

This document outlines a 10-day (non consecutive day)  development plan for building a self-tracking app using React Native. (Based on the tiktok challenge 75 hard a fitness wellbeing challenge :) ) 

## Day 1: Project Setup

- **Initialize the React Native project**.
- **Configure the development environment** for both iOS and Android platforms. ✅

## Day 2: Basic UI Layout

- **Design the main interface** with components for tracking daily activities. ✅
- **Implement navigation** between primary screens using React Navigation.✅
- **Apply basic styling** to establish a consistent look and feel. ( Let's style at the end :) 

## Day 3: State Management ✅ 

- **Integrate a state management library** Redux.✅ 
- **Define the global state structure** for tracking user inputs and progress.  ✅ 
- **Implement actions and reducers** to manage state changes.✅ 

## Day 4: Local Data Persistence ✅ 

- **Set up local storage** using AsyncStorage ✅ 
- **Implement data saving and retrieval** to maintain state across app restarts.✅ 
- **Test data persistence** to ensure reliability.✅ 

## Day 5: Activity Tracking Features

- **Develop components** for logging activities such as workouts, water intake, and reading.
- **Create forms or input methods** for users to enter activity data.
- **Validate and store activity entries** in the local state and storage.

## Day 6: Progress Visualization

- **Integrate a charting library** to display user progress over time.
- **Design visual representations** (e.g., graphs or charts) for tracked activities.
- **Ensure data is accurately reflected** in the visualizations.

## Day 7: Notifications and Reminders

- **Implement push notifications** to remind users of pending activities.
- **Schedule notifications** based on user preferences or predefined times.
- **Handle user interactions** with notifications to update the app state accordingly.

## Day 8: User Settings and Preferences

- **Create a settings screen** for users to customize their experience.
- **Allow configuration of notification preferences**, activity goals, and other settings.
- **Persist user preferences** using local storage.

## Day 9: Testing and Debugging

- **Conduct thorough testing** of all app functionalities.
- **Identify and fix bugs** or inconsistencies in the user interface and logic.
- **Ensure compatibility** across different devices and screen sizes.

## Day 10: Finalization and Deployment

- **Optimize performance** and refine the user interface.
- **Prepare the app for deployment** by configuring necessary settings.
- **Deploy the app** to a device or emulator for final testing.
